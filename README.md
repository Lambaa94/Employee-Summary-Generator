## Description
This project is very useful to gain the knowledge necessary to work with multiple classes and to know how to work with testing your code. I learned that working with *jest* to test your code in *JavaScript* is very useful and can be a time saver. Testing as you go can lead you to solving bugs early in the process rather than trying to find them in the end. It's like having a grocery list that you can check off when you have the items required. Working without this process can be done but I do see the positives in working this way. 

Working with classes and constructors has given me more of a structured environment when working with files that have to cohabitate. It also cuts down on the lines of code that you will need to have. In this project you will use the *command line interface* to curate a team and will organize the team in their own boxes with information that is tied to each team member.
